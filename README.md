# Face and Digit Detection with MNIST Dataset

This GitHub repository contains a Python project that uses the MNIST dataset for both face and digit detection. We employ three different classifiers: k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Naive Bayes, and Perceptron, to recognize faces and digits within the dataset.

## Project Overview

In this project, we explore the use of machine learning classifiers to distinguish between two types of images:

1. **Faces**: We aim to classify images as either containing a face or not.
2. **Digits**: We intend to classify images as digits and identify the digit represented.

We employ the popular MNIST dataset, which is widely used for digit recognition tasks, and a subset of the dataset containing face images.

## Classifiers

We use the following classifiers to tackle the face and digit detection tasks:

1. **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**: A simple yet effective instance-based learning method.
2. **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on the Bayes' theorem.
3. **Perceptron**: A single-layer neural network for linear classification.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset consists of a vast collection of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) and a subset of images with faces. You can download the dataset from the official MNIST website or use popular machine learning libraries like scikit-learn to access it.
